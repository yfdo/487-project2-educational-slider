          <p>Cyberpunk is a subgenre of science fiction in a dystopian futuristic setting that tends to focus on a
            "combination of lowlife and high tech" featuring advanced technological and scientific achievements, such as
            artificial intelligence and cybernetics, juxtaposed with a degree of breakdown or radical change in the
            social order.
            Various forms of media have been exploring this concept, including literature, film, video game and comics.
            This slider will lead you through its anime adaptation and developement.</p>

          <p>The Japanese cyberpunk subgenre began in 1982 with the debut of Katsuhiro Otomo's manga series Akira.
            The story is set in a post-apocalyptic and futuristic "Neo-Tokyo", more than two decades after a mysterious
            explosion destroyed the city. The mangaka Otomo uses conventions of the cyberpunk genre to detail a saga of
            political turmoil, social isolation, corruption, and power. Akira has influenced numerous works in
            animation, comics, film, music, television and video games. For example, The Matrix and Inception.</p>
