        <p>Cyberpunk is a subgenre of science fiction in a dystopian futuristic setting that tends to focus on a
          "combination of lowlife and high tech" featuring advanced technological and scientific achievements, such as
          artificial intelligence and cybernetics, juxtaposed with a degree of breakdown or radical change in the
          social order.
          Various forms of media have been exploring this concept, including literature, film, video game and comics.
          This slider will lead you through its anime adaptation and development.</p>

        <p>The Japanese cyberpunk subgenre began in 1982 with the debut of Katsuhiro Otomo's manga series Akira.
          The story is set in a post-apocalyptic and futuristic "Neo-Tokyo", more than two decades after a mysterious
          explosion destroyed the city. Otomo uses conventions of the cyberpunk genre to detail a saga of
          political turmoil, social isolation, corruption, and power. Akira has influenced numerous works in
          animation, comics, film, music, television and video games.</p>

        <p>Ghost in the Shell is a neo-noir cyberpunk thriller film based on the manga of the same name. The film is set
          in 2029 Japan, and follows a cyborg public-security agent who hunts a mysterious hacker. The narrative
          incorporates philosophical themes that focus on self-identity in a technologically advanced world. The Matrix
          series took several concepts from the film, including the Matrix digital rain and the way characters access
          the Matrix through holes in the back of their necks.</p>

        <p>Cyberpunk in Anime is seen as a subgenre of Japanese cyberpunk. In contrast to Western cyberpunk which has
          roots in New Wave science fiction literature, Japanese cyberpunk has roots in underground music culture. In
          Japan, where cosplay is popular and not only teenagers display such fashion styles, cyberpunk has been
          accepted and its influence is widespread. Cyberpunk anime and manga draw upon a futuristic vision which has
          elements in common with Western science fiction and therefore have received wide international acceptance
          outside Japan.</p>
